# Memory-Project-in-Verilog
A memory project in Verilog models storage elements like **RAM or ROM**, where data can be written to or read from specific addresses. It typically uses **register arrays** with address, data, clock, and control signals (read/write enable). Such designs help simulate and implement **cache, buffers, or main memory** in digital systems.
